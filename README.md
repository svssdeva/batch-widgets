# React based Batch Flow

Welcome to the repo of the most amazing project ever created! Okay, maybe not the most amazing, but it's still pretty darn cool. This project is built using the latest and greatest technologies, including Bun, Vite, React, and TypeScript. Buckle up, because we're about to take your development experience to the next level!
What's the Deal with These Technologies?

# Bun ü•Ø

Bun is a brand-new JavaScript runtime that's faster than a cheetah on a rocket-propelled skateboard. It's like a souped-up version of Node.js, but with WebAssembly superpowers that make it ridiculously fast. With Bun, you'll be able to build and run your applications at lightning speed, leaving your CPU crying for mercy.

# Vite ‚ö°

Vite is a blazing-fast build tool that will make you question whether you're living in the future. It's like a high-speed train for your development workflow, getting your project up and running in the blink of an eye. No more waiting around for your code to compile while watching your hair turn gray.

# React + TypeScript üß†

React is the popular JavaScript library that everyone and their grandma is using to build amazing user interfaces. And with TypeScript in the mix, we're adding a layer of type safety that will catch those pesky bugs before they even have a chance to cause chaos. It's like having a superhero sidekick that keeps your code in check.

# WebAssembly üï∏Ô∏è + Rust ü¶Ä

WebAssembly is a powerful technology that allows you to run high-performance code in the browser. And what better language to harness this power than the mighty Rust? With its focus on performance, safety, and concurrency, Rust is the perfect companion for WebAssembly. In this project, we'll be using Rust to create robust types and data models, ensuring that our code is as solid as a rock.
It's like having a souped-up engine under the hood of your web application, giving you the speed and power you need to tackle even the most demanding tasks. With Bun's WebAssembly and Rust support, you'll be able to harness this power like never before, while keeping your code safe and secure.

## Some secret sauce

(Currently not being used in any other react based FE repo)

- zod (ts schema validation stuff)
- jotai (state management)
- wasm + rust (for type safelty | in plans ~~~)
