# Bun ðŸ¥¯

Bun is a brand-new JavaScript runtime that's faster than a cheetah on a rocket-propelled skateboard. It's like a souped-up version of Node.js, but with WebAssembly superpowers that make it ridiculously fast. With Bun, you'll be able to build and run your applications at lightning speed, leaving your CPU crying for mercy.

# Vite âš¡

Vite is a blazing-fast build tool that will make you question whether you're living in the future. It's like a high-speed train for your development workflow, getting your project up and running in the blink of an eye. No more waiting around for your code to compile while watching your hair turn gray.
